# Applied-Statistics-R

The synthesis of heterogenous data and the development of software - is a combination now recognized as data science. Therefore, the field of Applied Statistics has a key role in our understanding of data relationships and associations by testing statistical theorems and econometric theory which can support the broader scope of data science in explaining uncertainty. 

In this teaching page, we explain some key examples relevant to some applications from Applied Statistics. 

## [A]. Data handling Techniques (Inserting/Merging/Exporting)




## [B]. Linear and Generalized Regression Models

A model formula in R has the following form:

$$ \mathsf{response} \ \sim \ \mathsf{linear} \ \mathsf{predictor}$$ 

where the response corresponds to the response (or dependent) variable and the linear predictor corresponds to the set of explanatory variables.
